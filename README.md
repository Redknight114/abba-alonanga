# Alonanga Abba – GIS Analyst & Open Mapper

Welcome to my GIS and spatial analysis portfolio.  
I specialize in QGIS mapping, terrain analysis, JOSM editing, and improving OpenStreetMap data for better planning and decision-making.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a town planning enthusiast and a growing GIS analyst focused on:

- QGIS analysis and cartography  
- JOSM editing for OSM  
- Data cleaning, tagging corrections, and QA work  
- DEM visualization (slope, hillshade, elevation)  
- Community mapping and voluntary open data contributions  

I enjoy solving real mapping challenges, improving local geodata, and supporting development projects.

## 📂 Featured GIS Projects

### 🔹 Flood-Risk Analysis – Maiduguri
Created a 100m buffer around a water body and intersected it with building footprints to identify at-risk structures.  
Skills: buffering, intersection, DEM integration, analysis.  

Folder: `/projects/flood-risk-analysis`

---

### 🔹 Building Footprint & Road Tag Corrections – OSM/JOSM
Corrected several mis-tagged roads (`highway=residential` → `footway`) and improved building footprint accuracy.  
Skills: quality control, tagging standards, data cleanup.  

Folder: `/projects/building-footprint-corrections`

---

### 🔹 Dubai (Maiduguri) Community Mapping
Mapped buildings and features to support planners, NGOs, and organizations like BOGIS.  
Skills: digitizing, imagery interpretation, coverage improvement.  

Folder: `/projects/maiduguri-dubai-mapping`

---

### 🔹 DEM Slope & Terrain Visualization
Processed DEM data to generate slope and elevation maps.  
Skills: raster styling, terrain analysis, QGIS DEM tools.  

Folder: `/projects/dem-slope-visualization`
